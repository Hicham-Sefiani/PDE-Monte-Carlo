The initial problem is the following : 
<br>
We are given a compact 2-dimensional set $\mathbb{D} = [0, 1]^{2} \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$,
and a boundary function regular function $\varphi$ defined on the border of $\mathbb{D}$.
<br>
We consider the Dirichlet problem defined by the following Laplace's equation :
$$\forall (x,y) \in \mathbb{D} ,  \frac{\partial ^{2} f}{\partial x^{2}}(x,y) + \frac{\partial ^{2} f}{\partial y^{2}}(x,y) = 0$$
and the Dirichlet boundary condition :
$$\forall (x,y) \in \partial \mathbb{D}, f(x,y) = \varphi(x,y)$$
This equation is commonly encountered in a number of branches of physics : electrostatics, gravitation, and fluid dynamics.
<br>
We can also interpret is as a steady-state heat equation : $f(x,y)$ would be the temperature at coordinates x and y in a given square $\mathbb{D}$ whose border temperatures are kept constant (and equal to $\varphi$ in the border). The objective, in this case, is to deduce the temperature $f(x,y)$ in all points $(x,y)$ inside the 2D square.
